# Vacation-Loco
Web project for CIS300 in spring 2023

This project is a 9-page website for a fictional travel agency called Vacation Loco. Vacation loco focuses on vacations in South America and Mexico. I came up with the name using a random business name generator and went from there choosing locations.
