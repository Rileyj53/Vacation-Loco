        Panama City, the country's capital, is a bustling metropolis with a modern skyline that contrasts with the
        historic architecture of the Casco Antiguo district. The old town has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage
        Site, and its colonial-era buildings and plazas provide a window into Panama's rich history. Visitors can stroll
        the narrow cobblestone streets, visit historic churches, and explore museums that showcase the country's
        pre-Columbian history and the building of the Panama Canal.</p>

    <p>Panama is also known for its stunning natural beauty. Bocas Del Toro is a popular destination for those seeking
        to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. This archipelago of islands on the Caribbean coast is known for its

        coffee plantations, where visitors can learn about the process of growing and harvesting coffee, as well as
        sample some of the world-renowned coffee produced in the region.</p>

    <p>Panamanian cuisine is a mix of African, Spanish, and indigenous influences, and seafood features prominently in
        many dishes. Visitors can sample traditional dishes such as ceviche, sancocho (a hearty soup), and arroz con
        pollo (rice with chicken) at restaurants throughout the country. For those looking for a lively nightlife scene,

        hikers, the ultimate challenge is to hike to the peak of Volcán Barú, the highest mountain in Panama.</p>

    <p>Panama's many national parks offer other exciting outdoor activities such as ziplining, birdwatching, and
        wildlife spotting. In Soberanía National Park, visitors can go on a zipline canopy tour and get a bird's eye
