        <h3 class="title">Costa Rica</h3>
        <p>Costa Rica is a Central American country known for its stunning natural beauty and rich culture. Located
            between
            Nicaragua to the north and Panama to the south, Costa Rica is home to a diverse range of ecosystems, from
            pristine beaches and tropical rainforests to towering mountains and active volcanoes.</p>

        <p>One of the unique aspects of Costa Rican culture is the country's strong commitment to conservation and
            sustainability. Costa Rica has made significant efforts to protect its natural resources, including its
            impressive biodiversity, and has established numerous protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife
            reserves. Visitors to Costa Rica can witness the country's commitment to sustainability firsthand by

            its many eco-tourism opportunities, such as hiking through lush rainforests, visiting butterfly gardens, and

        <p>Costa Rican cuisine is also an important aspect of the country's culture. The traditional cuisine of Costa
            Rica
            is characterized by fresh, local ingredients and a wide variety of flavors and spices. Some popular dishes
            include gallo pinto, a breakfast dish made with rice and beans, and ceviche, a seafood dish made with fresh
            fish, lime juice, and chili peppers. Other must-try dishes include arroz con pollo, a savory rice and
            chicken
            dish, and chifrijo, a hearty bowl of rice, beans, pork, and avocado.</p>

        <p>Visitors to Costa Rica will find plenty of exciting activities to enjoy, from ziplining through the
            rainforest to
            surfing some of the world's best waves. Some other popular activities include whitewater rafting, hiking to
            waterfalls, and soaking in hot springs. For those who want to relax, Costa Rica has many beautiful beaches
            and
