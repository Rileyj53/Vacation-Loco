        <p>As of now, many South American countries have relaxed their travel restrictions due to Covid-19. However, it
            is important to note that restrictions and requirements can vary depending on the country and region.Most
            countries require travelers to have a negative Covid-19 test taken within a certain time frame before
            arrival, usually 72 hours. Some countries may also require additional testing upon arrival or during the
            course of the trip.</p>

        <p>In addition, some countries may require travelers to complete health forms or provide proof of vaccination.
            It is important to research the specific requirements for each country before traveling and to keep
